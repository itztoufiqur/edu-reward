# Tokenized Class Participation System

## Overview

The Tokenized Class Participation System is a smart contract-based solution for managing and rewarding student participation in class activities. Students earn tokens for participation, which can be redeemed for rewards or privileges. This system uses Ethereum-compatible blockchain technology and is built with Solidity.

### Key Features

- **ERC20 Token**: Utilizes OpenZeppelin's ERC20 token standard for creating and managing tokens.
- **Token Awarding**: Allows the contract owner to award tokens to students.
- **Token Redemption**: Enables students to redeem tokens for rewards.
- **Pausable**: The contract can be paused and unpaused by the owner to manage token activities.
- **Burnable Tokens**: Tokens are burned upon redemption, ensuring they cannot be reused.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Solidity**: Version 0.8.x
- **OpenZeppelin Contracts**: For ERC20 and other functionalities
- **Ethereum-Compatible Network**: For deploying the contract (e.g., Ethereum, Polygon)
- **Development Tools**: Remix IDE, Hardhat, or Truffle

### Installation

1. **Install Dependencies**: If using Hardhat or Truffle, install OpenZeppelin contracts via npm.

    ```bash
    npm install @openzeppelin/contracts
    ```

2. **Contract Code**: Save the provided Solidity code in a file named `ParticipationToken.sol`.

### Deployment

1. **Using Remix IDE**:
   - Open Remix IDE (https://remix.ethereum.org/).
   - Create a new file named `ParticipationToken.sol` and paste the contract code.
   - Compile the contract.
   - Deploy the contract to an Ethereum-compatible network using the Deploy & Run Transactions tab.

2. **Using Hardhat**:
   - Create a new Hardhat project.

     ```bash
     npx hardhat
     ```

   - Add the contract code to `contracts/ParticipationToken.sol`.
   - Write a deployment script in the `scripts/` directory.
   - Deploy the contract:

     ```bash
     npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network <network>
     ```

3. **Using Truffle**:
   - Create a new Truffle project.

     ```bash
     npx truffle init
     ```

   - Add the contract code to `contracts/ParticipationToken.sol`.
   - Write a migration script in `migrations/`.
   - Deploy the contract:

     ```bash
     npx truffle migrate --network <network>
     ```

## Usage

### Awarding Tokens

The contract owner can award tokens to students using the `awardTokens` function. Example:

```solidity
function awardTokens(address student, uint256 amount) external onlyOwner whenNotPaused {
    // Award tokens
}
```

### Redeeming Tokens

Students can redeem their tokens using the `redeemTokens` function. Example:

```solidity
function redeemTokens(uint256 amount) external whenNotPaused {
    // Redeem tokens
}
```

### Pausing and Unpausing

The contract owner can pause or unpause the contract using the `pause` and `unpause` functions. This is useful for temporary suspensions of token activities.

```solidity
function pause() external onlyOwner {
    _pause();
}

function unpause() external onlyOwner {
    _unpause();
}
```

## Events

- **TokensAwarded**: Emitted when tokens are awarded to a student.
- **TokensRedeemed**: Emitted when tokens are redeemed by a student.

## Security Considerations

- Ensure the contract is audited and tested thoroughly.
- Handle token management and reward logic securely.
- Follow best practices for smart contract security.
